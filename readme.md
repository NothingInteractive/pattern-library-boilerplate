# Nothing :rocket: Pattern Library Boilerplate

A boilerplate for building pattern libraries on top of Patternlab. It uses [Patternlab Edition Node - Webpack](https://github.com/Comcast/patternlab-edition-node-webpack) as foundation and is preconfigured for Nothing's internal tools and frameworks.

## Installation and Starting

1.  Download/clone
2.  `npm install`
3.  `npm run patternlab:serve`

See [upstream repository](https://github.com/Comcast/patternlab-edition-node-webpack) for further information.

## Getting Started

### List all of the available commands

To list all available commands type:

    npm run patternlab:help

### Generate Pattern Lab

Generate documentation front-end:

```sh
    npm run build
```

Generate production bundles:

```sh
    npm run package
```

Will store CSS, JavaScript, images and other assets minimized and production ready in the
`dist` folder. Output location can be placed. See configuration manual.

### Watch for changes and re-generate Pattern Lab

To watch for changes, re-generate the front-end, and server it via a BrowserSync server, type:

    npm run serve

Webpack dev server should open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser, both host and port are configurable in the `patternlab-config.json` file.

### Pattern Lab - Configuration

Unlike the other editions, there were a few options added just for this edition that allow for easier upgrading, and better flexibility.

#### Setting Dev Server Settings

You can set the url and port number in the configuration for

    "server": {
        "url": "http://localhost",
        "port": 3000
    },

#### Setting the Webpack Merge Options

It's important to make the configuration for webpack something very easy to update, and very easy to modify. The current setting for webpack merge are described [here.](https://github.com/Comcast/patternlab-edition-node-webpack/blob/master/source/_app/readme.md)

You can change how it merges by changing this object in `patternlab-config.json`:

"webpackMerge": {
"entry":"replace"
},

By default merge does a `append` if that option works for you only set which webpack configuration you want to change. The merge setting is: `smartStrategy` which is documented over on this [page.](https://www.npmjs.com/package/webpack-merge#mergesmartstrategy-key-prependappendreplaceconfiguration--configuration)

#### Create bundle for production use

To use the CSS, JavaScript and other assets in a project, you create a package of your assets that can be included in any web project.
You can use the `package` section in the `patternlab-config.json` the same way as the `public` configuration to define an output
destination for your bundle. For example, when working in a repository that contains the pattern library along with a CMS in a different folder,
you can point the output of the package build task to the static/asset folders of your CMS.

Defaults:

```json
{
  "paths": {
    "package": {
      "root": "./dist",
      "js": "./dist/js/",
      "images": "./dist/images/",
      "fonts": "./dist/fonts/",
      "css": "./dist/css/"
    }
  }
}
```
